## Brazil FIFA 2022 Analysis

# Project Objective
A possible Win.

Reasons they won't get to the Finals.

# Data Sourcing
Data was gotten from #30days challenge platform 

# Data Preparation
### Data Cleaning and Visualization was done on Power-Bi
This Dataset was quite easy to work with, as there wasn't much cleaning to do.
I changed the "Forward" in  Position column of the Squad table to "Striker", because the term "Striker" is more relatable for understanding.

I also added a Column "Age Group" to the World Cup 2022 Squad Table. This table was created to classify the players Age into a specific range as seen below.

# Findings 
Brazil, according to FIFA ranking, ranks Number 1 and is the only Country that has ever won the World-Cup five (5) times. This datasets conforms with the history that brazil has never missed any World Cup tournament since the existence of World-cup in 1930. Brazil only won once on penalty, which is year 1994. 

Brazil squad which consist of more young players, and middle aged players than older players, are great so far because of team work. The top 10 players of team according to CAPS(Matches played with the national team) shows they are the best of the team over time.  Brazil team has one of the finest and good players that are excelling in their various position.

## A possible Win
Although this isn't enough reason to win, yet a chance to win. Brazil has good records, and so we can expect the team to want a win. A win is possible "if", 7 out of the top 10 players are on the field in every match. A win is possible if there's proper plannings are fixed on how each plays and how substitute are placed, hence players won't get worn out during the match.

## Reasons they won't get to the Finals
Not putting their best players on the pitch.
Not subtituting players when the needs comes up.
Inadequate strategy for every upcoming match.
Not training well against every match.
Allowing their best players to be worn out.
